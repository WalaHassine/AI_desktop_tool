# AI Models Documentation

This directory contains the AI models and associated scripts for the project. Below is a brief overview of the contents:

## Scripts
- **preprocess.py**: This script is responsible for preprocessing the data before training the AI models. It includes functions for data cleaning, normalization, and transformation.
  
- **train.py**: This script is responsible for training the AI models using PyTorch. It defines the model architecture, loss functions, and optimization algorithms.

- **predict.py**: This script is responsible for making predictions using the trained AI models. It loads the model weights and processes input data to generate predictions.

## Models
- **model.pth**: This file contains the trained PyTorch model weights. It can be loaded for inference or further training.

## Usage
To use the scripts, ensure that you have the required dependencies installed, including PyTorch. You can run the scripts from the command line or integrate them into your application as needed.

## Contribution
If you wish to contribute to the AI models or scripts, please follow the project's contribution guidelines and ensure that your code is well-documented and tested.
