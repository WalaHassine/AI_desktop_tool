The file /my-project/my-project/ai_models/models/model.pth is a binary file that contains the trained PyTorch model weights. As such, it cannot be represented as text. You would typically generate this file by running the training script (train.py) in your project, which saves the model weights to this path.

If you need to create the model.pth file, you should run the training script after implementing your model in train.py.
